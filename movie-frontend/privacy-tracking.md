## Privacy and Tracking

No personal tracking or analytics scripts have been implemented in this project to respect user privacy. However, console logs were used during development to monitor errors and application flow.

If tracking were to be implemented later, it would follow privacy-first principlesâ€”only collecting non-identifiable interaction data and using consent-based analytics solutions like Plausible or Fathom, which do not store personal data or use cookies.
