## Accessibility and SEO

To ensure the application is accessible, I used semantic HTML where possible, such as buttons for actions and labels for inputs. I included `aria-labels` where applicable for screen readers and ensured proper color contrast in the dark theme for readability. Keyboard navigation is possible for all interactive elements like buttons and inputs. Additionally, text elements like headings and paragraphs were used appropriately to aid screen reader navigation and content understanding.

SEO optimization was considered by structuring content in a meaningful way, such as using `<h1>` for the main title and ensuring titles and content are descriptive. While single-page applications like this are limited in SEO due to JavaScript rendering, the app layout and descriptive metadata help search engines better interpret the content.
